## The BookCooper Repository

Our project is titled _The BookCooper - Virtual Book Exchange Platform_. Our team consists of Alex Liu (EE’25), Aidan Cusa (EE’26), and Isaac Schertz (EE’26). 

The project goal is to create a simple marketplace for book lovers, while not having to purchase a new book everytime and get no value for their old purchases. Here users have the ability to earn points for sending in undesired books, and then use points to purchase new ones. These points, called Book Bucks (B-Bucks for short) can also be purchased with real money. This Facebook-like online marketplace exchange is tailored made for all types of books. _The BookCooper_ will start small, being an exclusive marketplace for Cooper affiliated individuals, though will eventually reach to every book lover in the world!
